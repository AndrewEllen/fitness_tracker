# FIT

## How to build the FIT app yourself. (Android)

This project is designed and tested for Android 13 although it should support any device from Android 5 onwards. 

* These instructions are for building the APK on a PC using Windows 10 although this should work for other systems.


### Step 1 - Install Flutter

This project is being developed on Windows 10 using Android Studio, but the following instructions should also work for other operating systems and IDEs. 

To install Flutter and Android Studio on your PC you can follow the [Flutter Install Instructions](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) from the flutter dev website.

Ensure that you have properly installed and set up Android Studio and Flutter. This may require a PC restart once installed.

### Step 2 - Clone the repo

To clone the repository you can either Clone it or download it although it is best practice to clone it.

- Clone the repo

  Use "git clone git@github.com:AndrewEllen/fitness_tracker.git <path>" in the command line to clone the repository. Path specifies what folder to clone into.

  If you don't have git installed you can find the download for it [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)


- Download the repo

  Navigate to the repository root [here](https://github.com/AndrewEllen/fitness_tracker). Click the green "Code" button and select "Download Zip" at the bottom of the dropdown.

  Once you have done this don't forget to extract the zip file.


### Step 3 - Open the project folder in android studio

- Launch android studio.

- Select "file" at the top left of the window.

- Select "open" from the dropdown.

- Select the fitness_tracker folder, this folder should contain the src and builds folders inside of it. (If this doesn't work then you may have to select the "src" file instead).

- Select "OK" to open the project folder.


### Step 4 - Run Pub Get

Now that you have the project open you will need to run the pub get command. Navigating to "pubspec.yaml" inside of the "src" folder should give a prompt for the option on the top of the editor window.

If this is not the case then open the IDE's terminal and run "flutter pub get"


### Step 5 - Follow the instructions for setting up Firebase

Note: You will need to set up a firebase project [here](https://firebase.google.com/). This project uses Firestore Database, Firebase Auth and Crashlytics currently.

Follow the instruction [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=android) to setup firebase with flutter.


### Step 6 - Set up Database Rules

Open up the Cloud Firestore console and navigate to Rules.

Copy the rules from [DBRULES.md](DBRULES.md) and replace the default rules from firebase and save.


### Step 7 - Build the app

Assuming all has gone to plan the app should now be functional.

- On Android studio click the "build" button at the top of the window.

- Click "Flutter"

- Click "Build APK"


### Step 8 - Copy the APK to your device

Navigate to "src/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/" to find the "app-release.apk".

Copy the APK to your android device either through a USB connection or another way such as saving it to google drive and downloading it on the device.

Run the APK to install.
